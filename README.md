#cloud-native
   A repository for various cloud-native projects I am working on.
   
   
   ##Couchbase
      Deploy a couchbase cluster in K8s. Please note that although there is a couchbase operator available from couchbase but this
      deploys a couchbase server using a docker image of the couchbase  community server edition using a custom helm-chart.
   ##EFK
      Deploy an EFK ( elastic search, fluentd and Kibana ) cluster in a K8s cluster. 
      Also contains resources for deploying EFK in openshift.
